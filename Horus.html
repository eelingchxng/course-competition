    <p>He was the love child of Osiris and Isis, and as aforementioned, the circumstances surrounding his birth were quite unusual, there are even speculations of his birth being similar to that of a certain Jewish deity. Just as his counterpart, he was quite popular in his day uptil the point that every living king associated themselves with him through the use of the Horus name encased in a serekh(a palace facade around the horus name of the king). He is often depicted as a man with a hawk head or a whole hawk. After his father's demise Horus fought Seth for the throne and ofcourse Order prevailed over chaos but during the course of the battle, Horus lost his left eye. No worries, it was returned to him and became a symbol of protection in Egypt know as the Wadget eye. It was after that battle that Horus was crowned King of the living King of Egypt. Here is an interesting tid-bit about his eyes; the right eye was the morning star/sun and his left eye represented the moon; this explained the lunar phase to the Egyptians.
    His popularity went past Egyptian borders as Horus was later identified by the Greeks with Apollo,
    and the town of Idfū was called Apollinopolis (“Apollo’s Town”) during the Greco-Roman period.</p>
