<h1><center>Osiris<center></h1>

  <p>
    Hands down, he was by far one of the most relevant gods in Egyptian history and the original specimen for the resurrection element that most religions feature today. Fun fact, even though he is a major Egyptian deity, Osiris was not even of Egyptian descent; we cannot categorically tell you where he was from but there you have it. As the story has it, Osiris was the son of Geb (Egyptian god of Earth) and Nut (Egyptian sky goddess), he had other siblings and they feature vividly in his story. Apparently, his popularity as a pharaoh was not sitting well with his brother Set, so Set decided to tread the path what many-a-jealous brother after him walked (we see you Cain). Not only did he kill Osiris, but there was some butchering and mutilation involved, after which he scattered the parts in the River Nile.
Telling you what happened next in detail would encroach too much on Isis story, so in a nutshell, she resurrected him and they went on to have a kick-ass baby boy. They gave us the impression that he might have been more dead than alive because he ended up going down in history as the god of the land of the dead and regeneration. He is also associated with order, agriculture and winemaking. Also, every dead Pharoah and later on commoner, was associated with Osiris in death.
