  <h2>Osiris</h2>
  <p>
    Hands down, he was by far one of the most relevant gods in Egyptian history and the original specimen for the resurrection element that most religions feature today. Fun fact, even though he is a major Egyptian deity, Osiris was not even of Egyptian descent; we cannot categorically tell you where he was from but there you have it. As the story has it, Osiris was the son of Geb (Egyptian god of Earth) and Nut (Egyptian sky goddess), he had other siblings and they feature vividly in his story. Apparently, his popularity as a pharaoh was not sitting well with his brother Set, so Set decided to tread the path what many-a-jealous brother after him walked (we see you Cain). Not only did he kill Osiris, but there was some butchering and mutilation involved, after which he scattered the parts in the River Nile.
Telling you what happened next in detail would encroach too much on Isis story, so in a nutshell, she resurrected him and they went on to have a kick-ass baby boy. They gave us the impression that he might have been more dead than alive because he ended up going down in history as the god of the land of the dead and regeneration. He is also associated with order, agriculture and winemaking.

Isis:
She is just as important as Osiris, even more so, because without Isis he would be dead… in every sense of the word. She was associated with so many things, but like most women in ancient Egypt she was important because of her relationship with a man. The dynamics of her relationship with Osiris was quite weird if we measure it with modern standards, basically she was his sister on a more complicated note, she was his wife but it is safe to say that they made it work. When her husband died she was as distraught as ever, she retrieved her husbands body to perform burial rites but when Set found out, he snatched the body away, cut it into 14 pieces and threw them in the Nile. Set’s wife (spoiler; she was also his sister, talk about family drama) Nepthys helped Isis retrieve the pieces, it is believed that when the pieces of dead Osiris was recovered by Isis, she spelled life into the dead body and brought back Osiris to life, and both united together to impregnate Isis with Horus. Later Osiris' spirit left the body and became the god of the dead.
Isis was known for a number of things but more than anything else she was associated with protection, healing, motherhood, children, fertility, and nature.
