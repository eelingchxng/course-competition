  <h2>Osiris</h2>
  <p>
    Hands down, he was by far one of the most relevant gods in Egyptian history and the original specimen for the resurrection element that most religions feature today. Fun fact, even though he is a major Egyptian deity, Osiris was not even of Egyptian descent; we cannot categorically tell you where he was from but there you have it. As the story has it, Osiris was the son of Geb (Egyptian god of Earth) and Nut (Egyptian sky goddess), he had other siblings and they feature vividly in his story. Apparently, his popularity as a pharaoh was not sitting well with his brother Set, so Set decided to tread the path what many-a-jealous brother after him walked (we see you Cain). Not only did he kill Osiris, but there was some butchering and mutilation involved, after which he scattered the parts in the River Nile.
Telling you what happened next in detail would encroach too much on Isis story, so in a nutshell, she resurrected him and they went on to have a kick-ass baby boy. They gave us the impression that he might have been more dead than alive because he ended up going down in history as the god of the land of the dead and regeneration. He is also associated with order, agriculture and winemaking. Also, every dead Pharoah and later on commoner, was associated with Osiris in death.

Isis:
She is just as important as Osiris, even more so, because without Isis he would be dead… in every sense of the word. She was associated with so many things, but like most women in an 1  qwcient Egypt she was important because of her relationship with a man. The dynamics of her relationship with Osiris was quite weird if we measure it with modern standards, basically she was his sister on a more complicated note, she was his wife but it is safe to say that they made it work. When her husband died she was as distraught as ever, she retrieved her husbands body to perform burial rites but when Set found out, he snatched the body away, cut it into 14 pieces and threw them in the Nile. Set’s wife (spoiler; she was also his sister, talk about family drama) Nepthys helped Isis retrieve the pieces, it is believed that when the pieces of dead Osiris was recovered by Isis, she spelled life into the dead body and brought back Osiris to life, and both united together to impregnate Isis with Horus. Later Osiris' spirit left the body and became the god of the dead.
Isis was known for a number of things but more than anything else she was associated with protection, healing, motherhood, children, fertility, and nature.

Seth:
Now its time to talk about the black sheep of the family, on one hand his siblings represented growth and progress, he was all about the chaos and destruction. This was quite alright seeing that life in Ancient Egypt was all about maintaining balance, the chaos showed up and was vanquised by forces of good. In some stories, Set showed his bad side by ripping his way out of his mother’s side to be born instead of being born the normal way (a dramatic god, this one). You already know what happened with him and his brother, but here is something totally new and slightly contradictory, at first, the Egyptians saw Seth as a beneficial god. They believed he lived in the realm of the blessed dead. Seth was a god the Egyptians prayed to so he would help their dead family members. A while later, some Horus fanatics turned him into a force for good to reckon with. Do not get started on his relationship with Horus, lets just say The Lion King has the similar idea with Simba and Scar.

Horus:
He was the love child of Osiris and Isis, and as aforementioned, the circumstances surrounding his birth were quite unusual, there are even speculations of his birth being similar to that of a certain Jewish deity. Just as his counterpart, he was quite popular in his day uptil the point that every living king associated themselves with him through the use of the Horus name encased in a serekh(a palace facade around the horus name of the king). He is often depicted as a man with a hawk head or a whole hawk. After his father's demise Horus fought Seth for the throne and ofcourse Order prevailed over chaos but during the course of the battle, Horus lost his left eye. No worries, it was returned to him and became a symbol of protection in Egypt know as the Wadget eye. It was after that battle that Horus was crowned King of the living King of Egypt. Here is an interesting tid-bit about his eyes; the right eye was the morning star/sun and his left eye represented the moon; this explained the lunar phase to the Egyptians. His popularity went past Egyptian borders as Horus was later identified by the Greeks with Apollo, and the town of Idfū was called Apollinopolis (“Apollo’s Town”) during the Greco-Roman period.

Anubis: Some interesting epithets of his are 'the embalmer' and 'the mummifier', that pretty much gives away his line of work. How many gods of death does one civilization need you ask? They are the Egyptians and we all know that they loved their afterlife a little bit too much, as such, it is no surprise that they placed as much emphasis on it as they did on the land of the living. He was often depicted in Jackal form or with a human body and a Jackal head, in some stories he oversaw the mummification of Osiris and that landed him the duty of overseeing all Egyptian mummification.He was originally a god of the underworld, but became associated specifically with the embalming process and funeral rites. In the Pyramid Texts of Unas, Anubis is associated with the Eye of Horus who acted as a guide to the dead and helped them find Osiris. Anubis watched over the whole process and ensured that the weighing of the heart was conducted correctly. He then led the innocent on to a heavenly existence and abandoned the guilty to Ammit. All in all, he was a pretty good guy.
