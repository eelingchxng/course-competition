            <p>Some interesting epithets of his are 'the embalmer' and 'the mummifier', that pretty much gives away his line of work. How many gods of death does one civilization need you ask? They are the Egyptians and we all know that they loved their afterlife a little bit too much, as such, it is no surprise that they placed as much emphasis on it as they did on the land of the living. He was often depicted in Jackal form or with a human body and a Jackal head, in some stories he oversaw the mummification of Osiris and that landed him the duty of overseeing all Egyptian mummification.He was originally a god of the underworld, but became associated specifically with the embalming process and funeral rites. In the Pyramid Texts of Unas, Anubis is associated with the Eye of Horus who acted as a guide to the dead and helped them find Osiris. Anubis watched over the whole process and ensured that the weighing of the heart was conducted correctly. He then led the innocent on to a heavenly existence and abandoned the guilty to Ammit. All in all, he was not what you'd expect for the god of death...a pretty good guy.</p>
