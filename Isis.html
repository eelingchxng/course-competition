  <p>She is just as important as Osiris, even more so, because without Isis he would be dead… in every sense of the word. She was associated with so many things, but like most women in an Ancient Egypt she was important because of her relationship with a man. The dynamics of her relationship with Osiris was quite weird if we measure it with modern standards, basically she was his sister on a more complicated note, she was his wife but it is safe to say that they made it work. When her husband died she was as distraught as ever, she retrieved her husbands body to perform burial rites but when Set found out, he snatched the body away, cut it into 14 pieces and threw them in the Nile. Set’s wife (spoiler; she was also his sister, talk about family drama) Nepthys helped Isis retrieve the pieces, it is believed that when the pieces of dead Osiris was recovered by Isis, she spelled life into the dead body and brought back Osiris to life, and both united together to impregnate Isis with Horus. Later Osiris' spirit left the body and became the god of the dead.
  Isis was known for a number of things but more than anything else she was associated with protection, healing, motherhood, children, fertility, and nature.</p>
