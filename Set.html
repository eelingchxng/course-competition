        Set rising from darkness at dawn in glory. King of the red land, Lord of the Sands.
        Come forth and be praised. <br>

    <p>Seth:
    Now its time to talk about the black sheep of the family, on one hand his siblings represented growth and progress, he was all about the chaos and destruction. This was quite alright seeing that life in Ancient Egypt was all about maintaining balance, the chaos showed up and was vanquised by forces of good. In some stories, Set showed his bad side by ripping his way out of his mother’s side to be born instead of being born the normal way (a dramatic god, this one). You already know what happened with him and his brother, but here is something totally new and slightly contradictory, at first, the Egyptians saw Seth as a beneficial god. They believed he lived in the realm of the blessed dead. Seth was a god the Egyptians prayed to so he would help their dead family members. A while later, some Horus fanatics turned him into a force for good to reckon with. Do not get started on his relationship with Horus, lets just say The Lion King has the similar idea with Simba and Scar.</p>
